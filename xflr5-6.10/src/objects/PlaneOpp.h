*@brief
*	This class defines the operating point object which stores the data of plane analysis
*
	Each instance of this class is uniquely associated to an instance of a WPolar, which is itself uniquely
	associated to a Wing or a Plane object.
	The results associated to each of the plane's wing is stored in WingOpp objects, declared as member variables.
	The data is stored in International Standard Units, i.e. meters, seconds, kg, and Newtons.
	Angular data is stored in degrees.
